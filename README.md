# Learn Angular 2

As it stands this repository is just a [side project](http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2016/05/27/if-this-strip-was-a-side-project) of John's, in which he committed a few tagged releases of tutorials he worked through based on the Angular2 documentation. 

If it turns into anything cooler than that you'll be the second to know. First I'll probably tell [Jenniffer](https://github.com/JennifferLockwood).
